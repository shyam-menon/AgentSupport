# Support Tool System Design

## Overview
An intelligent support ticket analysis system that helps support agents find relevant solutions based on historical ticket data. The system utilizes Azure OpenAI embeddings and vector similarity search to provide resolution steps, similar tickets, and troubleshooting suggestions.

## Target Audience
- Primary Users: Support agents (approximately 50 concurrent users)
- Administrative Users: System administrators for data management and system maintenance

## Core Features

### Support Agent Interface
1. Issue Search and Input
   - Free text description input
   - Dropdown selection for Issue Type (optional)
   - Dropdown selection for Affected System
   - Additional details text input
   - Configurable number of similar tickets to display (default: 5)

2. Results Display
   - Combined/merged resolution steps from similar cases
   - List of relevant MSSI ticket numbers with resolutions
   - Common solutions for the issue type
   - Suggested troubleshooting steps
   - Timestamps for previous resolutions
   - Export functionality (PDF/text format)

### Administrative Interface
1. Data Management
   - Secure CSV file upload interface
   - Record deletion/modification capabilities
